Project Proposal

1. The objective is to simulate a guitar string. We are trying to model a perfectly elastic flexible loss-less string. 

2. Sound waves are a regular (infact essential) phenomenon in our day to day life.  
   We are trying to simulate the vibration of a simple guitar string and visualise what we call music.
   The motivation for this problem lies in understanding the dynamics of sound waves in acoustic instruments.

3. Our assumptions are perfectly flexible and loss less which no acoustic instrument is. 
   We do not expect an exact solution. However an emperical one is certainly desirable. 

4. Having a knowledge and programming and mechanics is essential to analyse such problems so, 
   I would be able to model the problem and analyse the solution quantitatively and qualitatively 

5. Basic knowledge of C and Elementary Acoustics is essential 

6. A knowledge in advanced programming languages is a credit. Morever we can re-model this problem including losses which can refine
   the solution.
